## **ðŸ“Œ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using NLTK and Scikit-learn**
This project performs sentiment analysis on the Movie Reviews dataset from the NLTK corpus using four machine learning classifiers:

Naive Bayes (from NLTK)

Random Forest (via Scikit-learn)

Logistic Regression (via Scikit-learn)

Support Vector Machine (SVM via Scikit-learn)

Each review is classified as either positive (pos) or negative (neg), and the model performance is evaluated accordingly.

ðŸ§° Libraries Used
nltk â€“ Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing and classification

scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning algorithms for classification

random â€“ For shuffling the dataset

ðŸ“š Future Improvements
Display most informative features for Scikit-learn models (coef_ and feature_importances_)

Visualize classifier performance using confusion matrix or ROC curves

Improve feature extraction with TF-IDF, n-grams, or lemmatization

Train on larger movie review datasets like IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes
